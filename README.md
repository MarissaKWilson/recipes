# Recipes

I know what you're thinking. 

*Recipes? Like for food? On Github? But... why?*

I'm glad you asked! 

Version control lends itself very nicely to recipe refining. It allows me to easily iterate on past attempts. I can make a new branch and try something. If it works, I can merge it in. If it doesn't work, then I know what I've tried before.

It also makes it easier to share my most requested recipes. Yes, you too can finally have my rosemary bread recipe!

Please note only recipes in the master branch are guaranteed\* to be good.

\*The recipe is good, the implementation is up to you.

## Notes:

Whenever possible I cook by weight. To get the best out of your recipes you should have a kitchen scale that can measure in grams.
