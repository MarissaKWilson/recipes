# Basic Bread Recipe

**Yield:** 1 loaf / **Active Time:** 1 hour / **Inactive Time:** 6 hours

### Notes:
This is my go to bread recipe that I alter in various ways. It's based on the [Serious Eats Simple Crusty White Bread](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/08/simple-crusty-white-bread-recipe.html) recipe. I've tweaked it a bit to suite my needs.

I find 1 loaf is good for 2-3 people; I make 2 (or more) loaves if there's 4 or more people.

I use a stand mixer for this recipe. You can also make it by hand; the taste and texture come out the same.

Also note, you can use all purpose or bread flour in this recipe. If using all purpose, you will have to knead longer to get the same texture. 

This goes great with homemade butter!

## Ingredients:

1. 250 grams flour (see note above)
2. 3 grams instant yeast 
3. 6 grams kosher salt
4. 175 grams warm water
5. Cornmeal for dusting

## Directions :
Mixing is different depending on your method. The directions are the same after mixing.

#### These directions are for using a mixer: 

1. Measure out all the dry ingredients in the bowl of your stand mixer.
2. Mix together briefly<sub>1</sub> then make a divot in the middle and add the warm water.
3. Using the dough hook attachment, set mixer to 2 and run until dough begins to come together.
4. Turn mixer up to 4-6. Keep an eye on your mixer (it tends to wander) and let run for about 20 minutes. Check dough at 10 and 15 minutes, scraping down the hook and the bowl with a soft spatula. You can check for the dough for the "window pane" stretchiness at these times. Bread flour tends to take 15 - 22 minutes; all purpose can take anywhere from 17 to 30 minutes depending on it's gluten content.
5. Continue in the "after mixing" section

#### These directions are for mixing by hand:

1. Measure out all the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl.
2. With a wooden spoon, mix the dry ingredients.<sub>1</sub> Make a divot in the middle of the flour mixture and add the warm water.
3. Mix with a wooden spoon until dough comes together in a rough ball.
4. If mixing by hand, turn the dough out onto a floured counter and knead the dough for about 20 minutes. Dough will look smooth and slightly shiny when it's done. 
5. Continue in the "after mixing" section

#### After mixing:

1. Add a spoonful of flour to a medium sized mixing bowl. Turn the bowl to coat the bottom and sides with flour. Dump out the extra flour.
2. Using a soft sided spatula, scrape your dough out of the mixing bowl into the floured bowl. Or, if mixing by hand move your kneaded dough ball to the floured mixing bowl.
3. Cover loosely with lid or kitchen towel and set aside to rise for 3 - 4 hours.<sub>2</sub>
4. When dough has doubled in size, preheat oven to 500 F. If using a cast iron skillet or bread stone place in oven to preheat. 
5. Turn out dough onto a well floured surface. Work dough into a ball, then shape as desired.<sub>3</sub>
6. Add corn meal to a bread peel, place your dough on top, and cover with a linen or flour sack towel. Rest for 30 - 40 minutes.<sub>4</sub>

### Baking  
1. Just before baking use a sharp knife to score the top of your bread.<sub>5</sub> Different score marks will change the shape of your bread as it bakes
2. Using your bread peel slide the dough onto your pre-heated bread stone or cast iron. Using a spray bottle, mist the bread.<sub>6</sub>
3. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, it will look like bread when it's ready. You can also try the "knocking" test; holding the bread with tongs knock on the bottom. It should sound hard and not dense when it's baked.
4. Remove bread from oven using tongs, place on cutting board to cool for 20 minutes.<sub>7</sub>
10. Using a bread knife slice your bread.

If you have any extra bread it will stay good for several days in a gallon bag with a paper towel covering the cut end. 

Bread can also be par-baked and frozen to be re-baked another day. To do so, follow directions above but remove from oven about 15 minutes in to bake. Place in freezer safe bag and freeze. To resurrect bread, bake in a preheated 500 F oven for 15 minutes further. 

You can also bake this bread on a cookie sheet instead of using cast iron or stone. This will not lead to *as* crusty bread, but it's still pretty good. This also allows you to bake more loaves at once. After shaping your bread, place on parchment paper on your cookie sheet instead of the bread peel (do not preheat cookie sheet). The other instructions should be the same.

## Footnotes: 
<sub>1</sub> When mixing the dry ingredients you do not need to be thorough. This just prevents clumps of yeast or salt forming within the dough.

<sub>2</sub> Make sure not to place your dough anywhere too warm while it rises. This will lead to overly large bubbles within the bread.

<sub>3</sub> If dough is resistant to shaping, it let sit for a few minutes. The dough will "recover" if it hasn't been torn. I will be adding more on shaping in the future.

<sub>4</sub> Any amount of touching the dough from this point onward will change the shape and rise of your bread. Be careful!

<sub>5</sub> Different score marks will lead to different shaped bread. These score marks are where the bread will expand as it bakes. If bread is not scored enough or in the right direction it is prone to bursting in the oven. Burst bread is still delicious! Ideally, you don't want to score deeper than .25 inch into your loaf. If baking a circular loaf, try making an "X" on the top of the bread. If baking a torpedo shaped loaf, try making 3 75 degree cuts down the length of your bread. I will be adding more on scoring in the future.

<sub>6</sub> Misting the bread is optional, but steam within the oven is what adds the "crust" to this crusty bread.

<sub>7</sub> Bread is easiest to cut when it's been cooled an hour or more but this is how *I* make bread, and I'm not usually that patient.
